## About the Internship

As a Java Development Intern at ShadowFox, I worked on multiple projects that honed my skills in Java programming, socket programming, and unit testing. This internship was instrumental in enhancing my understanding of both fundamental and intermediate-level Java development concepts.

## Tasks Completed

### Console-Based Calculator
I developed a **Console-Based Calculator** in Java, which includes:
- Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Input validation and error handling
- A simple and interactive console interface

### Console-Based Contact Management System
I created a **Console-Based Contact Management System** to manage contact information, featuring:
- CRUD operations for managing contacts
- Data storage using arrays/lists
- A console-based interface for interaction

### Java Chatting Application
I built a **Java Chatting Application** using socket programming, allowing:
- Real-time messaging between multiple users
- Implementation of Java socket programming for networking
- A simple GUI for chat interaction

### Bank Account Management System with Unit Testing
I extended a **Bank Account Management System** by adding unit tests using JUnit, covering:
- Deposit and withdrawal functionalities
- Balance inquiries and transaction history validation
- Test-driven development principles

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages:** Java
- **Testing Framework:** JUnit
- **Networking:** Java Sockets
- **Tools:** Visual Studio Code (VSCode), IntelliJ IDEA
- **Data Management:** Arrays, Lists

    ```
  Run the system:
    ```bash
    java ContactManagementSystem
    ```

- To run the Chatting Application, navigate to the chatting application directory and compile the Java files:
    ```bash
    javac Client.java Server.java
    ```
  Run the server:
    ```bash
    java Server
    ```
  Run the client:
    ```bash
    java Client
    ```
